	   London, May 2 (Bloomberg) -- Britain's Labour party won a
landslide majority in Parliament, ending 18 years of Conservative
party rule and making Tony Blair, 43, the youngest prime minister
since 1812.
	   Conservative economic policies, on the other hand, will outlive
their designers. Blair has promised to maintain such cornerstones
of the former government as selling state assets, holding down
income taxes and spending, and capping inflation.
	   The British Broadcasting Corp. projected Labour will hold a
187-seat majority and Sky News predicted 181, which would top the
144-seat majority won by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in
1983 after the Falklands War.
	   The size of the majority drove down stocks in after-hours
trading amid concerns that a strong Labour government may not feel
compelled to stick with campaign promises on taxes and spending.
NatWest Securities predicts the FT-SE 100 Stock Index will open 60
to 80 points lower today, after closing at a record high at 4445
points Thursday.
	   The pound was little changed as expectations that interest rates
will rise as early as next week offset earlier concern about the
size of Labour's majority.
	   ``With such a massive majority they'll be able to do things they
might not have tried to do with a smaller majority,'' said Adrian
Pinkus, the head of U.K. equity trading at Merrill Lynch
International Ltd. The stock market could drop 1 percent, or 45
points, ``before regaining its composure,'' he said.
	   The pound rose as high as $1.6299 and 2.8085 German marks after
exit polls suggested Labour would win by enough to avoid a hung
Parliament. As Labour's margin grew, sterling pared its gains and
was last at $1.6235 and 2.7966 marks.
	   Of the first 526 seats decided, 382 went to Labour, 100 to the
Conservatives and 33 to the Liberal Democrats. Labour party
candidates gained an average of 10 percent on their Conservative
rivals throughout Britain.
	   The Conservatives were headed for their smallest showing in
Parliament since 1906.
	   ``Tonight we have been comprehensively defeated,'' Major said
after conceding defeat.
	   Major gave no indication of whether he would step down as
Conservative party leader, and senior party members declined to
speculate on whether there will be a leadership contest soon.
	   Six of 23 Conservative cabinet ministers have so far lost their
seats, including Defense Secretary Michael Portillo, Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, Trade Secretary Ian Lang, Leader of the
House of Commons Tony Newton, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
and Chief Secretary to the Treasury William Waldegrave. Portillo
and Rifkind had been seen as potential challengers to Major as
party leader.
	   Labour's majority means Blair may avoid the party infighting
that plagued Major in the last years of Conservative rule, analysts
said.
	   The scale of Labour's win was evident in such constituencies as
Birmingham Edgbaston, a seat in Britain's second-largest city that
the Conservatives had held since 1922. The Labour candidate there
won by a comfortable 4,842 votes.
	   Britons have chosen as their new prime minister a photogenic
lawyer first elected to Parliament in 1983. Blair became Labour
leader after the 1994 death of his predecessor, John Smith, and has
since single-mindedly purged the party of its high-spend and
high-tax policies and commitment to state ownership of industrial
assets.
	   Blair, the youngest prime minister since Lord Liverpool served
almost two centuries ago, is expected to bring new zest to the
prime minister's office at 10 Downing Street. He has three
school-age children, loves to play soccer and was a pop music
singer in college.
	   ``If we have been as successful as has been indicated, it is a
vote for the future,'' Blair said in his acceptance speech in his
home town of Sedgefield in northern England. ``It is not a vote for
outdated dogma of any kind.''
	   The Conservatives swept to power under Thatcher in 1979 and
implemented a radical agenda of reducing income taxes, selling
government-owned companies and reducing the power of unions.
	   Blair has promised to maintain many of the Conservatives'
policies, pledging not to increase government spending for two
years and not to raise the basic 23 percent or top 40 percent
income tax bands in the first five years.
	   ``The general view is that macro-economic policy, by which I
mean growth, inflation, interest rates, will be broadly similar,
whoever won this election,'' said David Kern the chief U.K.
economist at National Westminster Bank Plc.
	   However, Labour is expected to raise some taxes, to help pay for
campaign pledges to spend more on education and health care.
	   Blair, for example, has said he would impose a ``windfall tax''
on what he has said are excess profits by formerly state-owned
water and electricity companies sold to the public by the
Conservative government.
	   The U.K. fund management community also is concerned Labour may
scrap a 20 percent tax credit on share dividends available to
pension funds and other so-called institutional investors. That
could cause pensions to sells shares in favor of bonds, fund
managers have warned.
	   Blair's election would result in subtle changes in economic
policy, especially in Britain's relationship with the rest of
Europe. While Major was handcuffed by members of his own party who
oppose further moves toward a federal Europe, Blair has said a
Labour government would sign Europe's social chapter, which sets
standards for pay, hours and other working conditions.
	   Although promising more cooperation with Europe, Blair also has
promised a referendum if the government decides the U.K. should
join the proposed European single currency.
	   Analysts and investors also expect British interest rates to
rise as much as half a percentage point this month, regardless of
who won the election, to prevent economic growth from causing
inflation to accelerate.
	   Gordon Brown, who is likely to replace Kenneth Clarke as
Chancellor of the Exchequer, ``will grasp the nettle with a mid-to
long-term (interest rate) increase,'' said Jeremy Stretch, a
currency analyst at NatWest Markets.
	   Britain's base rate, the rate at which the Bank of England lends
to banks overnight, was last raised a quarter-point to 6.00 percent
on Oct. 30. A report that gross domestic product grew 3 percent in
the first quarter has caused speculation rates must rise again to
prevent the inflation rate from rising.
	   To be sure, Blair's pledge to pursue relatively conservative
economic and social policies may be challenged by Labour's left
wing. The left has historically flexed its muscles when the party
has had a large majority.
	   The Liberal Democrats, led by former soldier and diplomat Paddy
Ashdown, ran a distant third with about 18 percent support in the
polls, campaigning mainly on raising the basic income tax rate 1
percentage point to 24 percent to finance a 10 billion pound ($16.2
billion) five-year education program.
	   Pollsters have said voters are impressed by Labour's move away
from high-tax, high-spend polices, while internal rifts in the
Conservative party over Britain's membership of the European Union
cost the party support.
	   Major's six-week-long campaign, twice as long as normal in
Britain, failed to focus voters' attention on the country's
fast-growing economy.
