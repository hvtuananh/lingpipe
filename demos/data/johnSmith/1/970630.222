	   London, June 30 (Bloomberg) -- Scottish & Newcastle Plc, the
U.K.'s largest brewer, said fiscal 1997 profit rose as a strong
performance at its pub and beer units offset falling profit at its
Center Parcs resorts.
	   Net profit for the year ended April 27 was 286.2 million pounds
($466 million), up from 109.6 million pounds a year ago. The
figures imply a second-half net profit of 136.3 million pounds, up
from a loss of 8 million pounds in the second half a year ago, when
the company took a one-time reorganization charge.
	   Pretax profit, the most widely watched measure of corporate
performance in the U.K., increased to 374.1 million pounds from
308.2 million pounds. Analysts had forecast pretax profit of 373
million pounds, according to a Bloomberg survey. Earnings per share
rose to 45.8 pence from 39 pence.
	   ``They've done what most people wanted them to do,'' said
Dermott Carr, analyst at Nikko International Plc. ``The prognosis
is good.''
	   S&N's results come as the U.K. beer market, which has suffered
from overcapacity and sagging prices in past years, shows signs of
improvement. A pickup in consumer confidence in the U.K. is lifting
sales, and margins are improving as drinkers shift to so-called
``premium'' beers, or products such as ``ice'' beers.
	   The stock fell 4.5 pence to 646.5 pence.
	   Scottish & Newcastle retained its place as Britain's No. 1
brewer following a government decision last Friday to block the
acquisition of Carlsberg-Tetley by Bass Plc. The takeover would
have given Bass a 35 percent share of the British beer market
compared with S&N's 30 percent.
	   The failed acquisition will have ``no major impact'' on the U.K.
beer industry, said Finance Director Derek Wilkinson in an
interview.
	   ``Beer selling prices are moving ahead and margins are growing
and that's because of the strength of brands as much as
consolidation,'' Wilkinson said.
	   It is ``unlikely'' Carlsberg will cut prices to win back market
share, he said. S&N, Bass and Whitbread Plc will likely dominate
the U.K. industry from now on, he added.
	   Scottish & Newcastle's beer unit was boosted by Courage, the
former U.K. brewing arm of Foster's Brewing Group Ltd., which S&N
bought for 425 million pounds in 1995.
	   Operating profit from brewing rose 45.8 percent to 177 million
pounds. S&N brands include John Smith's ale, Foster's, Newcastle
Brown Ale and Kronenbourg.
	   S&N said profit at managed pubs such as the Rat & Parrot and
Chef & Brewer chains rose 12.1 percent to 148.7 million pounds.
Profit at tenanted, or leased, pubs fell 7.3 percent as the company
shed outlets to comply with terms set out by U.K. regulators as a
condition of allowing the Courage purchase. S&N had to sell 115
tied pubs within a year of the acquisition, and must get regulator
approval before buying any more.
	   Profit at the leisure division fell 10.6 percent to 76.5 million
pounds, dented in part by the pound, which has surged more than 18
percent against a trade-weighted basket of currencies in the past
year. The company operates Pontin's holiday parks in the U.K. and
Center Parcs resorts in Europe.
	   The strong pound cut 5.3 million pounds from profit earned at
overseas Center Parcs holiday resorts, Wilkinson said. S&N will not
sell the business, he said.
	   In the current year, the strong pound will mean the company pays
less for its imported German beers like Beck's. This will ``more
than offset'' the effect on Center Parcs' profit, he said.
	   The company paid a dividend of 14.17 pence, up from 12.88 pence
a year ago.
