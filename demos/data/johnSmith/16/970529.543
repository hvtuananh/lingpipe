	   Detroit, May 29 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. won't reach
its goal of boosting its U.S. market share to 33 percent in 1997
because strikes have crippled production, Chairman and Chief
Executive John Smith Jr. said.
	   In 1996, when it also was hurt by strikes in the U.S. and
Canada, GM captured 31.3 percent of the U.S. market, then a
post-World War II low for the world's largest automaker. The
company has said the 14 new car and truck models introduced this
year will boost its market position.
	   Smith said GM's market share will be higher this year than in
1996, but he wouldn't say how much.
	   ``It will be tough to get to 33 percent share with the
strikes,'' he told reporters.
	   GM settled a 50-day strike at its Oklahoma City car assembly
plant Saturday. Another strike continues at its Pontiac, Michigan,
assembly plant that builds full-size extended-cab pickups. The
company said earlier this month that the strikes have cost $225
million in lost profits so far.
	   The Oklahoma City plant makes Chevrolet Malibu cars, one of the
automaker's most important new models, and Oldsmobile Cutlass cars.
Smith said the lost Malibu production can't be made up because the
plant was operating at full capacity.
	   On Wednesday, UAW officials said GM agreed to create 280 jobs
now and possibly another 45 later to settle the Oklahoma strike.
Smith didn't comment on that specifically but did say the
settlement allows the plant to stay competitive.
	   ``I wouldn't call it a gain,'' he said of the agreement. ``We're
still in line to have the new car be very competitive in the
marketplace,'' Smith said.
	   The Malibu and its lower-volume sister model, the Cutlass, have
more efficient designs and use fewer parts. That allowed the
company to cut by a third the number of assembly hours, compared
with the Buick Century and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera that had been
built in Oklahoma City.
	   The company now will ``relaunch'' the Cutlass with a bigger
advertising and marketing campaign, Smith said. GM pulled back its
advertising during the strike on Malibu, which Chevrolet officials
said before the strike could become their best-selling model,
because the strike cut supplies on dealer lots.
	   Smith also said the company remains bullish on China's
automotive market, while Mercedes-Benz and other automakers have
expressed reservations recently about doing business there. ``The
potential of China is just tremendous,'' he said.
	   The company's joint-venture car plant in Shanghai likely will
begin production in April 1999, Smith said, though Chinese
officials have been hoping for December 1998. GM also wants to
build a minivan on the same assembly line that the plant will use
to build midsize Buicks, Smith said.
	   ``We'd love to do that but you have to get permission'' from the
government, he said. Mercedes has said it could break off
negotiations to build a minivan in China if the government doesn't
back off some of its demands.
	   GM also is talking with the government about taking over a
Peugeot car plant in Guangzhou province, where it would build a
low-priced car, possibly an Opel Astra.
	   Smith also said China deserves continued most-favored nation
status from the U.S. government, a designation that reduces tariffs
and makes trade easier for U.S. businesses. Congress will consider
renewing the status for China, whose designation expires June 3.
	   Not renewing ``is just going to cut off U.S. economic
opportunity with China, and I don't think that's very wise,'' Smith
said. GM Vice Chairman Harry Pearce said he continues to expect the
proposed sale of GM's Hughes Electronics Corp. defense subsidiary
to Raytheon Corp. to be completed by this year's fourth quarter.
Originally, the company said it would happen in the third quarter.
	   ``At the end of the day, the antitrust issues will be
resolved,'' Pearce said.
	   Smith also said that the sale of a stake in Delphi Automotive
Systems, GM's partsmaking unit, won't happen until next year.
That's later than originally anticipated.
	   GM is now about 75 percent through the 12-month, $2.5 billion
share buyback program announced in January, Smith said. He wouldn't
comment on whether the strikes have slowed the process.
	   Smith said he expects U.S. auto industry sales to be 15.3
million this year and that the company hasn't lowered its forecast.
Sales last year were 15.2 million.
	   On another matter, Pearce said GM's hourly pension plan remains
fully funded on an economic basis even though the plan took hits in
recent weeks on a drop in value of the stock of its former
subsidiary, Electronic Data Systems Corp.
	   GM is not diverting cash to fund the pension, Smith said.
	   EDS shares fell 23 percent to 32 1/2 after a disappointing
earnings report April 25, knocking $1.2 billion off the value of
the pension fund's 126.5 million EDS shares. EDS shares declined
1/8 to 37 3/8 today.
	   GM shares fell 1 today, to close at 56 3/4.
