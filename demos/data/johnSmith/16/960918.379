(Corrects to eliminate incorrect figures on Ford employment in
third paragraph.)
	   Detroit, Sept. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Stephen Yokich, president of
the United Auto Workers, sat in Ford Motor Co.'s headquarters
Saturday night cheering the Michigan Wolverines as they beat
Colorado's Buffaloes in football. Five hours later, the union's
contract with Ford expired, and Yokich didn't seem to care that
both sides were still far from coming to terms. For Yokich, no
agreement was possible unless Ford guaranteed 95 percent of his
members would keep their jobs. Forty-two tense hours after the old
contract expired, the union leader's tenacity won the day.
	   Ford's Chairman Alexander Trotman agreed to the job guarantee
after winning a key concession. The 95 percent guarantee will be
applied based on employment at each union local, giving Ford
greater flexibility to move workers where they are most needed.
	   ``The workforce guarantees may be the single most important
breakthrough of the agreement,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor
professor at the University of California at Berkeley. ``It halts
what has become an aggressive stampede by many U.S. firms toward
outsourcing.''
	   Automakers have outsourced both to cut costs and improve
quality. Yet the practice is one reason UAW membership has declined
50 percent since 1979, and Yokich, elected UAW president last year,
has sworn to stop the trend.
	   Analysts and executives say he will have little problem getting
the same job guarantees from Chrysler Corp., but no one expects
General Motors Corp. to go down without a fight.
	   Of the Big 3, GM is considered the least efficient manufacturer,
in no small part because it hasn't been able to get its workers to
allow as much outsourcing as Ford's or Chrysler's. Some have even
postulated that Ford agreed to the latest contract because its
terms were so unfavorable to GM. ``Ford likes nothing better than
to have something stick in the throat of GM,'' a Chrysler executive
said.
	   To trim its bloated cost structure -- GM has the largest and
oldest workforce and makes most of its parts in-house -- it will
have to convince the union that it deserves leniency.
	   ``We are a different company from Ford,'' John Smith Jr., GM's
chairman, said at a news conference today.
	   GM's initial contract offer to the union last week offered job
guarantees for current employees, but not for the workers it will
hire to replace some of the 30 percent of its workforce that is
expected to retire in the next few years.
	   GM's huge pension rolls, only recently fully funded, would be
further strained if the world's biggest automaker is forced to
agree to the terms of Ford's agreement.
	   Retirees, under the Ford contract, will see their monthly
pension payments rise to $2,260 a month from $2,085 over the next
three years. The company also eliminated a yearly $15,000 cap on a
retiree's non-pension income, according to a union member familiar
with the details.
	   Ford also agreed to a $2,000 bonus for each worker this year,
and a 3 percent pay raise for the next two years. That is a much
more lucrative option than the three lump-sum bonuses and no base
wage increases that GM had proposed.
	   ``I don't think GM could ever accept the contract, at least
based on the principles I've seen so far,'' said Lehman Brothers
analyst Joseph Phillippi.
	   Workers' annual education allowance in the Ford contract was
raised $800 to $3,800, and that money can be used to pay for their
children's education at $1,000-per-child, every year, the union
member said.
	   Ford also agreed to bring more parts work back in-house. Though
Ford agreed to bring the parts work back only if workers were paid
lower wages (estimated at $12 an hour) than other employees, the
stipulation still could hurt GM.
	   GM has said it wants to shed many of its parts operations to cut
costs, and may even spin off or sell off its Delphi Automotive
Systems operations in the next five years.
	   But there may be hope for GM. Yokich, himself, indicated
yesterday that the union might be more flexible with GM, as it was
with Ford and Chrysler in the 1970s and 1980s when those companies
hit the financial skids.
	   After three days of marathon negotiating sessions, Yokich had
the job security he wanted, but he said, ``We're going after an
agreement that all the companies can work with.'' -- Noelle Knox
