	   Detroit, April 14 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp.'s
first-quarter profit more than doubled, topping expectations, fed
by lower costs and higher car and truck output in North America
compared with a strike-plagued year-ago quarter.
	   GM said profit from continuing operations rose to $1.80 billion,
or $2.30 a share, from $800 million, or 93 cents.
	   The company was expected to earn $2.09 a share, the average
estimate in a survey of 13 analysts by First Call Corp.
	   ``It was somewhat better than I expected,'' said Burnham
Securities analyst David Healy. Earnings in Europe and at financial
subsidiary General Motors Acceptance Corp. were higher than he had
estimated, he said.
	   GM said car and truck earnings in North America, where it makes
Chevrolet, Cadillac, Saturn and other vehicles, were the best since
1984, rising to $764 million from a loss of $279 million.
	   In addition, the company's repurchase of 27 million shares for
$1.6 billion helped boost the per-share figure by spreading the
earnings over fewer shares, Healy said. GM began a 12-month, $2.5
billion stock buyback program announced in January.
	   GM shares were unchanged at 53 in midday trading.
	   Revenue for the quarter increased to $42.3 billion from $39.2
billion.
	   GM's international car and truck business, which sells Opel,
Vauxhall and other brands, earned $317 million, down from $432
million, because of slower sales and higher incentives in Europe
and lower earnings from Saab AB, the Swedish carmaker that GM half
owns.
	   Earnings in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region rose to
$168 million from $147 million.
	   GM's share of the worldwide car and truck market fell to 15.1
percent from 15.8 percent in the year-earlier quarter. In the U.S.,
its largest market, its share sank to 30.2 percent from 31.2
percent.
	   The company's European market share will remain steady for the
rest of this year, while it will rise in the U.S., said Chief
Financial Officer J Michael Losh. Share gains in Latin America and
Asia will occur in coming years as new plants there are completed,
he said.
	   GM officials predict the U.S. market share will rise from
current post World War II lows beginning at mid-year as Chevrolet
Malibu, Pontiac Grand Prix cars, Chevrolet Venture minivans and
more than a dozen other new car and truck models become more
available at dealers. Those cars are produced more efficiently than
the models they replaced, which is helping North American profit,
Losh said.
	   He added that North American operations should continue to
produce year-over-year earnings gains in 1997, led by the car and
truck business, the Delphi parts division and financial services.
	   In the most recent quarter, the company booked a one-time gain
of $55 million, or 7 cents a share, from Volkswagen AG's payment to
settle GM's industrial espionage lawsuit against VW. GM also
recorded a one-time charge of $50 million, also 7 cents, to close a
New Jersey parts plant.
	   In the year-earlier first quarter, GM recorded a gain of $72
million, or 7 cents a share, on the sale of a partial interest in
its Hughes Electronics subsidiary's DirecTV business.
	   Also, a 17-day strike at two Ohio brake plants in March 1996 cut
the automaker's North American production and reduced earnings by
$900 million, or $1.20 a share.
	   Excluding the strike impact and the one-time gains and charges,
profit from continuing operations rose to $1.79 billion from $1.02
billion.
	   Incentives rose in North America to $860 per vehicle from $598
in the year-earlier quarter, but Losh predicted they wouldn't rise
significantly in the second quarter.
	   The company's net profit margin rose to 4.8 percent from 2.3
percent, but was still below the company goal of 5 percent.
	   ``It's clear that we are headed in the right direction to
further strengthen the corporation's financial performance,'' said
Chairman and Chief Executive John Smith Jr.
	   The automaker said it had $14.6 billion in cash at the end of
the quarter, nearly double the year-earlier level.
