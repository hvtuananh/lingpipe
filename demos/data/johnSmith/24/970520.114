	   Until the 1970s, members of the Capitol Police force, which
began as a one-man guard force in 1801, were appointed strictly
through patronage bestowed by members of Congress. They were given
no training.
	   ``I went in probably on a Monday morning in June 1964,'' says
Talmadge W. Reed, a former Capitol Police officer. ``They gave me a
uniform and they found a hat that fit and a gun with no bullets.
They said put all this on. They said, `Go out on that corner and
direct traffic.' No training, no bullets. They said, `We're
scheduled to go down to the FBI range next Thursday, and we'll take
you along. If you can hit anything, we'll give you bullets.'''
	   Reed performed passably and was given bullets , but only five.
The chamber under the hammer was supposed to be kept empty in case
the revolver was set off by accident. Two other recruits failed the
test. ``They walked around with no bullets for a while,'' Reed
says.
	   None of the officers was given any books of parking tickets.
``We didn't know what we were doing anyway, but there was a fear
that we might give a ticket to the wrong person,'' Reed says. ``The
theory was everyone who walked on the Capitol grounds had a
congressman. So if we gave someone a ticket for parking, the
lieutenant would get a call from an irate congressman saying, `What
do you mean by giving John Smith a ticket?'
	   ``So they said, `If you want to give a ticket, you call us, and
we'll decide.' I never called. We had people parking in front of
fire hydrants.'' When Reed asked headquarters to tow a car blocking
a driveway, he was told, ``They'll be out soon.''
	   Nor were the Capitol Police about to ticket members for drunk
driving. Quite the contrary. The job of the Capitol Police was to
escort drunk members to their cars. ``I remember helping drunken
members find their cars and making sure they got started and out of
the parking lot,'' Reed says.
	   The Capitol Police force has 1,076 officers, 260 support
personnel and a budget of $74 million a year. They have full law
enforcement powers, are no longer selected by members and they
receive first-rate training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training
Center in Glynco, Ga. But they are as subservient as ever.
	   Congress loves to castigate the FBI and other federal law
enforcement agencies when it perceives political favoritism or
cover-ups. Yet in the topsy-turvy world Congress has created for
itself, Capitol Police officers who try to enforce the law or
protect themselves are punished.
	   Ernest M. Riddle, a former Capitol Police officer, recalls a
time he was guarding the old Democratic Club in the Congressional
Hotel:
	   ``There had been some thefts inside the building. ``They told us
to stop anyone coming out of the garage at night. The door opened
up , it was raining. This gentleman who turned out to be a
congressman came out. He had his hands in his pockets. He just
stood there and smiled at me. He was drunk.
	   ``When I asked him to take his hands out of his pockets, he
wouldn't do it. So I turned him around and put handcuffs on him. I
called my superiors. That was a no-no.''
	   Called to headquarters, Riddle was asked what he would do if the
same kind of incident occurred in the future. ``I said to protect
myself, I would do the same thing if someone wouldn't take his
hands out of his pockets ... So I ended up patrolling the
sub-basement of the Rayburn Building for six months.''
	   Paul R. McGill, a former officer, says he was directing traffic
on Independence Avenue when a member of Congress ran a red light.
``They figure they can go through any intersection,'' McGill says.
``He ran a red light and had an accident. I wrote up the report,
and they (the Capitol Police) changed it. He didn't like the idea
of being charged with the accident. Other officials over me changed
it.''
	   ``You couldn't write a parking ticket to a congressional aide or
secretary without its being fixed,'' recalls former officer George
Holmes. ``So the police came up with what was known as an Alabama
parking ticket. You just let air out of two of their tires. There
was no sense in writing a ticket.''
	   The Capitol Police are so brazenly averse to enforcing the law
that they even ignore criminal violations by ordinary citizens.
	   Paul Z. Herman, an officer who retired in 1992, says that when a
deranged man assaulted a charwoman working for the House side,
``the House officer made an arrest, and a lieutenant told him to
turn him loose. He had beaten her. I couldn't tell you what his
thinking was. A lot of them don't want their people to get
involved. It's that simple.''
	   In one of the more shocking examples of how irresponsible the
Capitol Police can be, they make it a practice when confronted by
mentally unbalanced individuals seeking access to the Capitol to
recommend that they go to the White House instead.
	   ``Every nut who came to Washington went to the Capitol or the
White House,'' says Richard Xander, a Metropolitan Police sergeant
who was detailed to the Capitol Police. ``Some weirdo came up, and
the best we could do was escort him off the Hill. Normally, we send
them to the White House. Then the Secret Service would do the
paperwork (to have them committed to St. Elizabeth's Hospital for
observation).
	   ``So many people come to the city and believe the president
lives in the Capitol. If it wasn't a flaming mental case, and we
didn't think he was going to hit someone right then and there, the
best thing would be to say, `Go west to 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue.'''
	   ``We would send nuts to the White House,'' confirms Capitol
Police sergeant John Gott. ``That's pretty much routine. I think
the uniformed Secret Service would do the same thing, sending them
to the Capitol.''
	   ``That always goes on,'' former Capitol Police captain Dave
Curry says. ``We send them to the White House, and they send them
to the Capitol.''
	   Indeed, says Paul McGill, ``We would put them in a taxi, give
them a dollar, and send them to the White House. The White House
would do the same thing.''
	   Capitol Police Chief Gary L. Albrecht declined to be interviewed
for this book, but a department spokesman, Daniel R. Nichols, said
that if officers are directing mentally deranged individuals to the
White House, ``they shouldn't be doing that.''
	   In addition, a Secret Service agent disputes that claim that
agents at the White House have sent such individuals to the
Capitol:
	   ``We would never send them to the Capitol. The Secret Service is
more competent at getting mentally disturbed persons admitted to
St. Elizabeth's because they know what the mental problems are and
can articulate them to the doctors. They can also write affidavits
and complaints and put it in the correct legal terms and get it
right. It's as simple as that.''
	   Of course, no one can predict whether a mentally disturbed
person directed to the White House might end up trying to
assassinate the president. In at least one case, the practice
resulted in an attempted attack on the president.
	   ``We did that with one guy (recommended he go to the White
House), and the Secret Service shot the guy,'' Xander says. ``He
jumped over the fence at the White House with a gun.''
	   As one former officer says, ``We used to joke, if we wrote a
book about Capitol Hill, nobody would believe it.''

PART TWO: WELCOME TO CONGRESS, LAND OF SILK DRAPES, WET BARS AND
$20,000 CHAIRS
	   When management consultant Scot M. Faulkner was charged with
cleaning up the House's accounting practices, he was stunned by
what he found , warehouses full of millions of dollars worth of
never-used furniture (some of it from the 1960s), politicians who
ordered $20,000 custom chairs, a pen-and-ink ledger system dating
back to 1774. He managed to push through some reforms, but many
denizens of Capitol Hill continue to decorate their offices in
royal style , at the taxpayer's expense. By Ronald Kessler.

PART THREE: THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST REP. SONNY BONO
