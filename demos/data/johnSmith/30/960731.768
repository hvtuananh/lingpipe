
	   ATLANTA , She is a native of Guadeloupe, lives in Hollywood and
runs for the French Olympic team. Now Marie-Jose Perec is making
huge splash in Atlanta.
	   Grace. Fearlessness. Confidence.
	   While Michael Johnson embarks on his well-publicized quest for a
historic double, and Carl Lewis crusades for a spot on the U.S.
Olympic team, Perec has quietly dazzled the audience here with the
seemingly effortless ease and grace with which she has dominated
competition.
	   Perec warmed the track for Johnson on Monday when she set an
Olympic record in the 400. She won the race in 48.25 seconds, a
comfortable 38-tenths of a second ahead of Cathy Freeman of
Australia. Few noticed that Perec pulled the second- and
third-place finishers higher: Freeman set an Oceania record and
Fali Ogunkoya of Nigeria set an African record.
	   After a day off, Perec was back on the track Wednesday beginning
her attempt to win a medal in the 200 meters.
	   The women's world record in the 400, 47.60 by Marita Koch of
Germany in 1985, was set at a time when athletes from the Eastern
bloc nations were suspected of, and in some cases proven, to use
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   In July, Perec said, ``That record is not human; it's not
possible.''
	   After winning the gold medal at the Barcelona Games in 1992, she
said her winning time, 48.03, was the legitimate time.
	   In the intervening years, as she has gained strength and
confidence, Perec no longer regards Koch's mark as beyond reach.
	   This is part of an evolution that began in Guadeloupe, where she
was raised by her grandmother. She moved to France when she was 14
after a French coach timed her in a 200-meter race in Guadeloupe
and informed her that she had qualified for the French National
team.
	   Perec was dropped by the French coach Jack Piasenta in 1994
after skipping the European indoor championships. That led her to
her current coach, John Smith, who she credits with instilling in
her a heightened self confidence and a quiet killer attitude.
	   ``He has a way of approaching things that's much more positive
than I was used to,'' she said. ``He puts my goals very, very high
and it's worked. As time goes on, I begin to believe that the
400-meter record might be possible.''
	   In the past, Perec was content to simply run fast; Smith
conditioned her to run to break records.
	   ``He told me I was wrong not to think about the world record,''
she said. ``I think I'm exceptional. I know that sounds pretty
American, but he has an American way of expressing himself. In
France, I didn't think I was exceptional. That's what he's brought
to me.''
	   Ato Bolden, the men's 100-meter bronze medalist, said that Perec
reminded him of the deadly Venus Flytrap, a flower that lures prey
with sweet fragrance and appealing looks.
	   ``People think she's timid,'' Bolden said. ``That is a
mistake.''
	   Perec doesn't crush the opposition like Johnson, or step on it
like Gail Devers. She sails past the field, easily, virtually
expressionless. She can be disarmingly unassuming. At the same time
Perec is aware of how she affects her competitors. During the track
and field trials, Perec noted with typical candor: ``When I run,
the other girls freeze. They run slower when I am there.''
	   That won't be the case Thursday when she runs against the likes
of of Carlette Guidry, Merlene Ottey, Freeman and Juliet Cuthbert.
	   Wednesday, she won her first two heats without sweating , the
first in 22.62 seconds, the second in 22.24, the fastest qualifying
time of the day.
	   Yet her approach to the possibility of winning two gold medals
is a marked contrast to Johnson's bold declarations and the
advertiser's grand marketing schemes.
	   When she speaks about going for a double, Perec reveals a
genuine sense of uncertainty. ``I don't know what's going to
happen,'' she said.
	   Critics say she is a pure 400-meter runner who only does the
200-meter to improve her speed. Perec disagrees, not loudly but
firmly. ``I'm not a 400 runner,'' she said. ``I'm a sprinter.''
	   The difference between her quest and Johnson's is experience,
she said, not intensity.
	   ``Michael Johnson knows what it's like to go for the 400 and
training for the 200 in the same meet,'' she said. ``I'm just going
to try. It's no risk.''
